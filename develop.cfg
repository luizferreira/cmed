# Buildout Configuration File for Standalone Plone
# ------------------------------------------------
# $LastChangedDate: 2011-07-18 16:04:13 -0700 (Mon, 18 Jul 2011) $ $LastChangedRevision: 51292 $
#
# After making changes in this configuration file,
# you should run bin/buildout to update the components.
#
# ALWAYS back up all Plone/Zope data and components
# before changing configuration.
#
# Running "bin/buildout" will update your installation,
# installing missing components as necessary.
#
# Use "bin/buildout -n" to update many components here to the newest
# available releases.
# This will update the add-on products you've added in the eggs= lines.
# This will not, however, upgrade Plone itself (or anything else you've
# pinned with a version specification). To upgrade Plone itself, see the
# comments in "Plone Component Versions".
#
# Tutorial instructions for using zc.buildout for
# configuration management are available at:
# http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/buildout
# Full details at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout

# Plone Component Versions
# ------------------------
# This version of the Unified Installer has the components of Plone 4
# preloaded so that it can install without an Internet connection.
# If you want to update, uncomment the "http://..." line below,
# edit it to point to the current version URL, comment out the
# "versions.cfg" line and run "bin/buildout" while attached to the
# Internet. Generally, you only want to do that as part of a planned migration.
# Note that if you are updating components, you should also check the versions
# section at the end of this file, since recipes or components other than
# those of Zope and Plone may need updating at the same time.
#
extends =

# If you change your Plone version, you'll also need to update
# the repository below.

############################################
# Ports
# -----
# Specify the port on which your Zope installation
# will listen:
http-address = 8080


# If you try to start Zope as root, it will change user id to run as
# the effective user specified here. This user id must own the var directory
# of your buildout.
effective-user = luiz


############################################
# Eggs
# ----
# Add an indented line to the eggs section for any Python
# eggs or packages you wish to include.
#
# Plone
# Pillow
# lxml

eggs =
    iw.debug
    plone.reload
    Products.PloneTestCase == 0.9.13
    Products.DocFinderTab
    Products.PDBDebugMode
    Products.enablesettrace
    bpython
    Paste # necessary to debugtoolbar.
    plone.app.debugtoolbar
    wres.policy

#   collective.js.jquery # TODO: Em breve remover esta linha, caso nao apareca problmas no jquery


# Optional Functionality
# ----------------------
# Uncomment the indented lines to include these add-on products.
# Documentation on all of them, along with many more products,
# is available at
# http://plone.org/products/
#
# Example products:
# * LinguaPlone provides tools for building multi-lingual sites
# * PloneFormGen provides through-the-web form building
#
#    Products.LinguaPlone==4.0.1
#    Products.PloneFormGen==1.6.0
#
# Note that versions may be specified here or in the [versions]
# section below. You should always specify versions that you know
# are compatible with the Plone release and at an acceptable
# development level.
#
# Commonly used development tools:
# Several excellent development tools are included in the develop.cfg
# buildout extension. Read it to learn how to activate these tools.


############################################
# ZCML Slugs
# ----------
# Some eggs need ZCML slugs to tell Zope to
# use them. This is increasingly rare.
zcml =
    iw.debug
#    plone.reload


############################################
# Development Eggs
# ----------------
# You can use paster to create "development eggs" to
# develop new products/themes. Put these in the src/
# directory.
# You will also need to add the egg names in the
# eggs section above, and may also need to add them
# to the zcml section.
#
# Provide the *paths* to the eggs you are developing here:
develop =
    src/wres.brfields
    src/wres.archetypes
    src/wres.theme
    src/wres.tour
    src/wres.policy
#    src/my.package


############################################
# Debug Mode
# ----------
# Change debug-mode to "on" to run in development mode.
# This will dramatically slow Plone.
#
debug-mode = on
# Add-on developers should turn deprecation warnings on
deprecation-warnings = on
# change verbose-security to "on" for useful security errors while developing
verbose-security = on


############################################
# Backup Directory
# ----------------
# Sets the target directory for the bin/backup and bin/snapshotbackup
# commands. Default is inside this project's var directory, but ideally
# this should be on a separate volume or backup server.
#
backups-dir=${buildout:directory}/var


############################################
# Environment Variables
# ---------------------
# Some of the behavior of your Zope/Plone instances are controlled with OS
# environment variables. You may set those here in a key / value format.
# Some common settings:
#    * TZ allows you to set a time zone for systems where it's not
#      automatically available.
#    * zope_i18n_compile_mo_files allows for automatic compilation of
#      missing translation files (may slow startup).
#    * zope_i18n_allowed_languages allows you to limit the available
#      translations.
#    * PYTHON_EGG_CACHE determines where zipped python packages are unpacked
#      for use.
environment-vars =
    zope_i18n_compile_mo_files true
    PYTHON_EGG_CACHE ${buildout:directory}/var/.python-eggs
    TZ America/Sao_Paulo
    #    TZ US/Eastern
    #    zope_i18n_allowed_languages en es de fr


############################################
# Initial User
# ------------
# This is the user id and password that will be used to create the initial
# user id that will allow you to log in and create a Plone site. This only
# sets the initial password; it will not allow you to change an already
# existing password. If you change the admin password via the web interface,
# the one below will no longer be valid.
# If you find yourself locked out of your Zope/Python installation, you may
# add an emergency user via "bin/plonectl adduser".
user=admin:senha1

# Versions Specification
# ----------------------
# Version information supplied here will "pin" Python packages to a particular
# version number, even when you use the "newest" flag running buildout.
# Specifying versions for all packages is a good idea and can prevent
# accidental changes when you add new packages to your buildout.
# Note that versions specified here will override those specified earlier
# in the configuration, including those from the Plone and Zope version
# config files.
